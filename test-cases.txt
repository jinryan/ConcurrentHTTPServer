==== Setup ====
- download https://zoo.cs.yale.edu/classes/cs434/cs434-2023-fall/assignments/programming-proj1/test-meeting.tar
- tar xvf test-meeting.tar
- start server using the test-http.conf under test-meeting
- the test steps are in test-cases.txt

==== HTTP Functions ====

- [Target 1]: Conform to request header and response
  telnet localhost 6789
  GeT /index.html HTTP/1.1
  GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
  GET /index.txt HTTP/1.1

  Response should include Date header, Server header, Content-Type header
    Content-Length matches file size
    Last-Modified matches file modification time ()
    Content-Type matches file suffix

  Can also visit using browser: http://localhost:6789/index.html


- [Target 2] GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
  Wait without issuing new line
  [Q: when is it that a request is in process?]

- [Target 3]: understand Host, give two different host names
curl -v -H "Host: host1.cs.yale.edu" http://localhost:6789/index.html
curl -v -H "Host: host2.cs.yale.edu" http://localhost:6789/index.html

- [Target 4] Understand Accept
// error case
curl -v -H "Accept: a/b" http://localhost:6789/index.html

- [Target 5]: User agent adaptation
curl -v -H "User-Agent: my-iPhone" http://localhost:6789/

- [Target 6]: If-Modified-Since [read file modification time at server and issue before and after]
curl -v -H "If-Modified-Since: Tue, 12 Dec 2023 19:29:46 GMT" http://localhost:6789/index.html

- [Target 7]: Connection
curl -v -H "Connection: close" http://localhost:6789/index.html http://localhost:6789/index.html
curl -v -H "Connection: keep-alive" http://localhost:6789/index.html http://localhost:6789/index.html

- [Target 8]: Authorization
curl -v http://cs434:passw0rd.@localhost:6789/protect/index.html

www-authenticate bonus

- [Target 9]: POST and CGI
curl -v -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -d "param1=val&param2=val" http://localhost:6789/test-cgi.cgi
curl -v -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -H "Transfer-Encoding: chunked" -d "@test-cgi-stdin.data" http://localhost:6789/test-cgi.cgi

[How does your server handle CGI script error/crash]

==== Server structure ====

- [Target 10] management and graceful shutdown test
   Approach 1: telnet
    telnet send partial request

   Approach 2: curl 
   step 0. test if limit-rate works
   curl -v --limit-rate 1K https://zoo.cs.yale.edu/classes/cs434/cs434-2023-fall/assignments/programming-proj1/alice_in_wonderland.txt

   step 1. curl -v --limit-rate 2K http://localhost:6789/data.txt
   step 2. issue shutdown in the management terminal

- [Target 11] timeout implementation [test in TC2]

- [Target 12] load design and implementation
  telnet
  GET /load HTTP/1.1
  Connection: Keep-alive
  [Q: how is it implemented?]

- [Target 13] nSelect structure design

- [Target 14] Phase/pipeline structure

- [Target 15 Additional/interesting designs, any benchmarking]
